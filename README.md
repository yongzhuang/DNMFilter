# DNMFilter
# Introduction

DNMFilter is a machine learning based tool designed to filter out false positive de novo mutations (DNMs) obtained by any computational or manual approaches from next generation sequencing data. It can be used as either a stand-alone tool to detect DNM or coupled with other commonly used DNM detection tool (GATK UnifiledGenotyper, polymutt, DenovoGear et al.) to improve specificity.
